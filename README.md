# FenixFetch
add-on extension for Firefox Android (Fenix) to allow quick access to github repo to update fenix apk

Hardcoded parsing of official mozilla github releases.atom page for latest apks matching *-armeabi-v7a.apk into links.

Add-on not public but is submitted, firefox-for-android version 120 expected to allow more extensions to be installed.

Intended for those running AOSP, F-Droid with no GApps and requiring sideloading apks.

NOT for desktop Firefox version, though it will work.

Has an options page with the parsed atom feed and an add-on icon that will open new tab with the parsed atom feed.

current release 1.0 has icons but its source does not due to github being unable to upload at present
